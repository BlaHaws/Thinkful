Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link below.

Using the 4 categories, KNN would be able to categorize customers as those that will pay their bills versus those that won't. We would need to normalize the categories. The distance would also be weighted using z-scores. For our model, we would choose k somewhere between 3-6. Finding a correlation between the purchases and bill payment would help us determine the variable in question.

1. You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.
2. You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.
3. You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
4. You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.

1. The bias here is that people are looking for a new bathing suit differently throughout the year. The views during February may have been higher because people were looking for a new suit, and lower in May because they already had a new suit. 

2. The bias is that you are using the individuals that come in to a clinic that specializes in anxiety versus the general population. Because you are specifically treating anxiety, you are going to receive an extreme number of individuals with anxiety.

3. The bias is that those who view a new billboard may be likely to inquire what the company is, without any intention of converting. People are curious.

4. The bias is the time of expected return. A loyalty program generally uses a given number of purchases/visits before a reward is given. This will require time for individuals to use the program and view the benefit of the program, which will then in-turn hopefully increase the usage.

Calculate the degree of each node:
Mom: 1 You: 4 Aunt Alice: 2 Fiancee: 4 Dave: 3 Brian: 3 

Write a list of edges:
{Mom, You}
{You, Aunt Alice} 
{You, Fiancee} 
{You, Dave} 
{You, Brian} 
{Fiancee, Dave} 
{Fiancee, Brian} 
{Dave, Brian} 

Calculate the clustering coefficient for each node: 
You: 8/20 
Mom: NA (only links to one node) 
Aunt Alice: 1 
Fiancee: 8/12 
Dave: 1 
Brian: 1 

Calculate the shortest paths between each pair of nodes: 
You,Fiancee: 1 
You, Mom: 1 
You, Aunt Alice: 1 
You, Dave: 1 
You, Brian: 1 
Fiancee, Aunt Alice: 1 
Fiancee, Mom: 2 (Fiancee, You, Mom) 
Fiancee, Dave: 1 
Fiancee, Brian: 1 
Aunt Alice, Mom: 2 (Aunt Alice, You, Mom) 
Aunt Alice, Dave: 2 (Aunt Alice, You, Dave) (Aunt Alice, Fiancee, Dave) 
Aunt Alice, Brian: 2 (Aunt Alice, You, Brian) (Aunt Alice, Fiancee, Brian) 
Mom, Dave: 2 (Mom, You, Dave) 
Mom, Brian: 2 (Mom, You, Brian) 
Dave, Brian: 1 

Calculate the betweenness centrality of each node: 
You: 6/12 
Fiancee: 2/12 
Mom: 0/12 
Aunt Alice: 0/10 
Dave: 0/11 
Brian: 0/11 

Find a walk of length 5 linking Fiancee to You: 
{Fiancee, Dave, Brian, Dave, You}

Find the shortest path linking Dave to Mom: 
{Dave, You, Mom} 

How long is a cycle linking You to Aunt Alice? 
3 {You, Fiancee, Aunt Alice, You}

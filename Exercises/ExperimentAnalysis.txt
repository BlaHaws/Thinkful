1. The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.

2. In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.

3. A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report.

4. When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.

5. To prevent cheating, a teacher writes three versions of a test. She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.

1. Using The Emperor and Darth Vader for presenting the slogans introduces bias in the droids. The droids may contain pre-existing favourable/unfavourable feelings toward a given presenter. The test should either be conducted with unknown, unbiased presenters, or with 1 of the original presenters presenting both. The former would probably be the better solution.

2. The population size compared to the average percentage won is not given. Jar Jar may have a higher percentage of conversion, but Mace Windu possibly had a higher overall total of conversions. The test would need to ensure that all planets contained equal population, equal pre-existing favourable feelings. The test may have also been skewed by the fact that 1 of the presenters was a Jedi and 1 was not. If the populace already harbours ill feelings towards Jedi's, many will reject listening to a Jedi.

3. The test would require using data from the countries that both HR and IT are located. This is due to different factors that each country may present on an employees job satisfaction, such as tax rates, political volatility, etc. 

4. The data could be skewed by the personalities, gender, and age of the users of the app. Those who are more likely to continue and increase physical activity steadily may choose to "opt in" while those who will not continually increase activity may not want to share their activity information.

5. The teacher failed to ensure a random distribution of the tests. This possibly resulted in pockets of students using test B to be seated near each other and cheating occurred. Also, the teacher did not take into account the over-all performance of the students that scored higher with test B. If the students were already A+ students, that studied for every exam and knew the material, the teacher cannot conclude that the test was easier for all students and therefore needed to be discarded. The teacher also failed as a teacher in thinking that tests were meant to be difficult and stump students instead of accurately reflecting the students knowledge and critical thinking skills.
